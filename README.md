# Tic-Tac-Pong
### A Game By Mitchell Philipp

Tic-Tac-Pong is a Player vs. Computer game for the GameBoy Advance. It combines the classic video game Pong with the pen-and-paper game Tic-Tac-Toe.

## The Rules
* Each player (the user and the computer AI) controls a paddle on either side of the screen.
* At the center of the screen is a tic-tac-toe board.
* A small ball, called a pong, moves around the screen and bounces off of the edges and the paddles.
* The players can move their paddles up and down in order to hit the pong and bounce it back toward the other player.
* Each player accumulates energy when they hit the pong with their paddle. Each player's accumulated energy is represented by a small battery icon on their side of the screen.
* Each player can accumulate a maximum of 12 energy.
* When a player hits the pong, they gain 2 energy. They also gain a bonus of 1 energy if the pong is moving particularly fast when they hit it.
* When a player fails to hit the pong with their paddle and it hits the wall behind them, they lose 1 energy.
* When a player accumulates the maximum 12 energy, their battery will flash cyan. When the battery flashes, the player can expend all the energy to charge their paddle, causing it to blink.
* When the pong is hit by a charged paddle, it becomes charged with the color of the player that hit it.
* When the pong becomes charged, open spots on the tic-tac-toe will begin to flash.
* When a charged pong passes through an open spot on the board, it will mark that spot with an X or O for the player that charged it.
* If a player hits a charged pong with their paddle, its charge switches to them, so that it can now score for that player on the board.
* The pong loses its charge if both players consecutively fail to hit it.

## Winning the Game
If either player manages to get three of their marks in a row on the board, they win immediately. If all the spaces on the board are captured, and neither player has three marks in a row, the player with the most marks on the board wins. Each player's total is displayed in the lower corner of the screen.
